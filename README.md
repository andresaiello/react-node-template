# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created by Andres Aiello

## Available sub projects

In the project you will find two main directories:

- backend: Project to run the backend on NodeJs. Look it's own readme for more information.
- fronend: Project to run the frontend on React / TypeScript. Look it's own readme for more information.

## Considerations

- I made two project instead of one because this is a sample project, and many times I want to made backend in Go or other tech, so this is easy to switch.
- By the same reason there's some models duplicated on backend and frontend, because this is just a sample and in a real scenario there's no guarantee the model is exactly the same on both sides.
